          Welcome to CodaLab.
        </h3>

        <p>CodaLab is an open-source web-based platform that enables researchers, developers, and data scientists to collaborate, with the goal of advancing research fields where machine learning and advanced computation is used. CodaLab focuses on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Optimizing the time spent by researchers on tasks such as preprocessing datasets, writing evaluation or visualization scripts, and running other people's code.
            </li>
            <li>Reducing duplicated efforts across different groups by facilitating the sharing of code and data.
            </li>
            <li>Enabling the creation of competitions to focus the community on areas needing benchmarking or improved computational methods.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>CodaLab helps to solve many common problems in the arena of data-oriented research through its online community where people can share worksheets and participate in competitions. CodaLab worksheets combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document, streamlining the research process and lowering the barrier to documenting and publishing detailed advanced computational research. CodaLab nurtures an environment of scientific rigor by enabling reproducibility and transparency, and opens new avenues for collaboration.</p> 

        <p>
          If you're using GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.

          Getting Started
        </h3>

        <p>
          There are two ways to use CodaLab: host a CodaLab instance, or use an existing CodaLab instance. Additionally, since CodaLab is open-source, we invite developers to contribute enhancements.
